## Milestone 1 - Docker Installation
I installed Docker using the tutorial from Docker Docs: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/, and also followed the Docker tutorial available with CodeWithMosh (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTFZFxd4hOI).
1) Download Docker Desktop for Windows and follow installation instructions.
2) Select the "Use WSL 2 based engine" option in Docker Desktop settings.

Below is a screenshot of my docker container terminal prompt.
